With growing competition due to increased participation, the DX Marathon is
holding true to its name! Dictionary.com defines marathon: “any contest or
event requiring exceptional endurance”. With the top five scores only one
point apart each, it really was a marathon battle for first place! In fact,
21 participants finished in the top ten – a 50% increase over last year.
Although there were four fewer entities available in 2013 for a maximum
possible score of 334 (compared to 338 in 2012), the 330 winning score
actually matched that of 2012. 2013 was indeed a very competitive year for
the Marathon. 10 meters really came to life in 2013 and overall activity on
10 was up 14% over 2012 and accounted for almost 15% of all Marathon QSO’s.
15m remained the single most active band with 25% of all QSO’s. CW
remained the favorite mode accounting for more than 50% of QSO’s. Digital
participation was down slightly but still represented 15% of all QSOs.
Single Band/Single Mode submissions increased over last year with some
amazing scores.

Overall submissions were up
7% over 2012 although there were fewer entries from Europe. Activity was
high as DX Marathon entrants submitted a total of 113,653 QSO’s! Formula
Class participation dropped to 20% reflecting comments from many of about
the antenna restrictions. Starting in 2014 the Marathon now has a third
class which is expected to increase the number of lower power participants.
See sidebar elsewhere in this article for details of the new Limited Class.

# And the Winners Are…

Although overall participation from
European stations was down in 2013, EU stations were very much in the battle
for the top spots in all classes. Since the inception of the Marathon in
2006, Eduard, OM3EY, has been a major contender every year and has never
finished out of the top five. He finished first in 2008, 2<sup>nd</sup>
three times, 3<sup>rd</sup> place two times and last year was 5<sup>th </sup>
in the Unlimited Class. But 2013 was his magic year and he was able to
capture the top spot with a score of 330. Not far behind Eduard was Bob,
W9KNI, with a score of 329. Most amazing was that Bob made all his QSO’s on
20 meters! Rounding out the top five with scores of 328, 327 and 326
respectively were EA1DR, KB0EO and IK0OZD. Congratulations to Eduard for
his Unlimited Class win!

Although the number of participants in
Formula Class was down from last year, the scores remained high! This
year’s top 100 Watt Formula Class honors go to Zoli, HA1ZH, with an
impressive score of 310. W4TV was once again runner-up with an equally
impressive score of 304. N4RI, K8CQ and E73Y filled the next three
positions in the top five. In the 10 watt or less Formula Class, Dan, WG5G,
repeated his feat of last year by taking first place with an amazing score
of 295. Congratulations to all of our Formula Class participants.

The single mode competitions continue to
attract additional participants and there was no shortage of high scores in
all modes. Soundly winning the Phone competition, Wayne, N0UN, lead the
group with a score of 323, well ahead of his competition. Last year’s
Formula Class winner, UT9FJ, entered Unlimited Class this year and decided
to pursue CW only. Missing only three CW countries that were active in
2013, Sam lead the CW competition with a score of 319. The Digital leader
for 2013 was Jack, WS3N with a score of 260 points. Each mode winner will
receive a plaque.

Additional plaques are also awarded for
the highest scores on the 10-80 meter bands and for the top continental
scores. The 15, 17 and 20 meter bands generated a lot of competition and
some very impressive single band scores. The Europe, North American and
South American competitions were also very close, with only three points
separating the top three positions in both Europe and North America. For
2013, we are awarding all plaques, so the runners-up for 20 meters, Europe
and South America will receive plaques. All band and continental plaque
winners are highlighted in the Top Scores chart elsewhere in this article.
As always, we sincerely appreciate the tremendous support of all of our
plaque sponsors. If you or someone you know would like to become a DX
Marathon plaque sponsor, please contact the author directly.

Certificates will be given to the top
scorer in each country and zone, plus the 6 and 160 meter top scorers, for
those who did not already qualify as a plaque winner. In the DX Marathon
Club competition, once again the Araucaria DX Group in Brazil took top
honors with a total score of 5,895. The Carolina DX Association was second
with a score of 4,740. If you are a member of a radio club, be sure to
include your club affiliation in your submission.

To help everyone improve their score,
each year we publish a list of busted calls, pirate calls and other helpful
information on the DX Marathon website. We are pleased to report that the
2013 error rate dropped significantly – from 2.35% in 2012 to 1.98% in 2013
and fewer actual subtractions than last year. The top spots are usually
only one point apart, so even one error can be significant. We are also
happy to report that twice as many entrants submitted error free logs
compared to last year, although over 85% of participants still had at least
one error. 55% of the errors were due to submissions with Invalid Calls.
Although many of those were real QSO’s where the entrant made a typing error
when entering the callsign in their log, many points were lost to bad spots
on the spotting networks. We encourage everyone to listen very carefully to
the DX station – never assume the callsign that was spotted is correct!


28% of the errors were due to claiming a
country different from what it actually was. We encourage all participants
to use electronic logging and update their country databases before
preparing their final Marathon submission. The majority of these errors can
be caught in software. 15% of the errors were due incorrect zones. We
continue to see a high number of errors in Zones 2,3,4,5. The DX Marathon
web page has a separate section dedicated to help determine whether that VE2
station is in Zone 2 or 5. For the USA zones, a manual check on QRZ.COM or
in the FCC database is often required. There are a number of stations with
KL, KP and KH prefixes that actually live in the lower 48 states. The
remaining 2% of the errors were due to Pirates.

With a database of almost 114,000 QSO’s,
there is a lot of information and data available. For example, in 2013, 20%
of all QSO’s took place in October and November, reflecting the excellent
band conditions and the large number of DXpeditions that took place then.
That figure is quite a change for previous years and confirms that the
Marathon is truly a year long event. The busiest three hour period for the
Marathon is 1400-1700Z accounting for almost 20% of all QSO’s. Winning the
Marathon often means working those countries that only make a few QSO’s each
year. There were three countries that between them accounted for only 13
QSO’s. Working rare countries can be quite a challenge! Zone activity
varies significantly as well, with Zone 2 accounting for only 345 QSO’s –
that means over 30% of participants were not able to work Zone 2! Zone 14
is the most popular zone, accounting for 11% of all Zone QSO’s. If there
are other statistics our readers would be interested in seeing, please
contact the author.

Top Scores listing and the detailed listing of all participant’s final
scores. For more detailed scoring information, please see the CQ and DX
Marathon websites. Good luck to all in 2014!
