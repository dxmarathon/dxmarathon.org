Each year there are pirates, operations that are not approved, callsigns that are
copied incorrectly and unusual operations that are valid. We attempt to document
as many of these operations as possible - see the lists of valid callsigns,
invalid callsigns, and callsign notes.We encourage you to share your findings on pirates, illegal operations or confusing callsigns with us. Please send your callsign updates to the DX Marathon administrator at: <font color="#0000FF">k9el at dxmarathon.com</font>

Many points are lost each year due to bad spots on the packetcluster network. We have
assembled an extensive list of bad spots - please check the list
before entering any of these callsigns!

Please check USA/VE zones carefully - use [www.qrz.com](https://www.qrz.com) to check
zones before submitting. The number in the callsign does not
necessarily match the location. Did you know that West Virginia (W8)
is in Zone 5? and that Alabama (W4) is in Zone 4? See US/VE zone
detail below.

Check Zone 2 	submissions carefully - see Zone 2 information below.
* When a prefix can count for more than country (e.g. E51) double check your entry.
* Although you can use the same QSO for a country and a Zone, if there is an error, two points will be lost! We suggest using a different QSO for country and zone.
* Review your submission carefully and make sure your logging program country database is up to date.
