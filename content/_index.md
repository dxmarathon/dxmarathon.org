Starting January 1 of each year and running until the end of December, the DX Marathon is the perfect answer for the DX-er who needs that extra incentive to get on the air every day!

Simply work as many countries and CQ Zones as you can in each calendar year, regardless of the band or mode.
Each country and zone counts only once, so you can concentrate on working new ones rather than working the same ones on multiple bands and modes. [Find more information in the rules](/rules).

Check our constantly updated [Helpful Hints](/resources/hints) to improve your 2022 score.

Many awards are given for the top overall scores in four classes plus top scores in modes, bands, US call areas and more!   Details of the [extensive award list are available here](/awards).
